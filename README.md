___
# Section 1: Brief
## 1.1 | Motiviation:
This project was motivated by the very dire need for a more accessible and streamlined way of communication between doctors and patients unlike what is usually present in the real world. Most traditional clinics are usually limited by how many patients they can take in a day and how many of the staff is able to work on any given day. Most tasks have the ability to be automated and streamlined using software solutions that will subsequently increase the capacity of doctors to receive more patients and the ability of patients to communicate with more doctors effeciently; All while keeping their prescriptions and visit statuses organized and accessible any time without the need to call in and ask a staff member.

## 1.2 | Build Status:
Currently the system is working as expected, all functionalities including the more sophisticated ones like video calling, live chatting, booking visits and downloading prescriptions are running with no known issues. Currently if any user is using a _**Chromium based**_ web browser; they will need to run a custom command through termninal on their machine:

**Win+R** run menu on windows.
